## **Step 2: Set Up Roles for Throney**

After adding Throney, create a **dedicated role** that will serve as the **"Officer"** role. This role grants access to the **Throney Dashboard** for managing your guild and alliance.

### **Required Roles & Permissions**

| Role                     | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎖️ **Alliance Officer** | Full access to the dashboard and all guilds.      |
| ⚔️ **Guild Officer**     | Manage a specific guild’s dashboard and commands. |
| 👥 **Member**            | Required for assigning users to a guild.          |

<Warning>
  Ensure that the **Officer role** is positioned **above all member roles** and that the `Throney bot role` is at the top of the role hierarchy.
</Warning>

***

## **Step 3: Initialize Throney in Your Server**

Once roles are created, use the following command in Discord to start the setup process:

```bash
/setup [alliance officer]
```

* Select the newly created **Alliance Officer** role.

* This will activate your **2-week trial** of Throney.

* You will see a **setup confirmation panel** like this:

<Info>
  **Note:** After the trial period, a subscription will be required to continue using Throney.
</Info>

***

## **Step 4: Access the Dashboard**

Once setup is complete, head over to the [Throney Dashboard](https://www.throney.gg) and log in.

* Click on your **Alliance**.

* You will see an interface similar to this:

* Click **"Update Guild"** and select the **correct member role** for each guild.

* By default, only **one guild** is created. You can **rename it** or **add additional guilds** as needed.

<Warning>
  Any updates to roles or changes in who has the officer roles will take up to 5 minutes to reflect. Alternatively, you can re-run the `/setup` command with the same role to apply the changes immediately. This is due to an efficiency limitation—thank you for your patience!
</Warning>

## **Step 5: Upload Your Character Data**

To start tracking members and event participation, **upload your character profile** by running the following command in Discord:

```bash
/upload
```

* Attach a **clear screenshot** of your character page, ensuring all relevant details are visible.

* A valid character profile should look like this:

![](/images/characterprofile.jpg)

<Tip>
  Ensure that **your class, level, and name** are clearly visible on the left-hand side of the screen.
