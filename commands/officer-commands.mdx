## `/attendance`

Logs attendance at the end of an event and tracks member participation. Officers can choose an event from a custom list created by the officer core. This command also integrates DKP values by assigning a configurable 'weight' to each event, allowing officers to track contributions effectively.

```bash
/attendance
```

Manually edit a user's data input in case of OCR errors. While we strive to make sure Throney is as accurate as possible, mistakes happen. this command is to correct them!

Officers can modify gear information if it was misread by the OCR. This is particularly useful for names with non-English characters.

```bash
/edit
```
