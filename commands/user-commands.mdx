## `/absent`

Use this command to mark yourself as absent for a specific timeframe. This will be logged in your profile and eventually reflected on the Throney dashboard and Dynamic Events (Signups).

typing /absent opens up a form, which asks for information related to your leave of absence.

```bash
/absent <From> <To> <Reason>
```

Absences automatically prevent you from appearing in Signups (Dynamic Events).
Officers can view absences in user profiles after T2 launch.

## `/return`
Allows you to return from an absence early, restoring your active status.

```bash
/return
```

This will update your status back to active in the system.
Your participation in Signups (Dynamic Events) will be back to normal when this feature is fully integrated.


🛠 Future Enhancements for Absence Tracking
- Officers will see absences on the dashboard after T2 launch.
- Users marked as absent will automatically be removed from event signups.
- Possible automated role adjustments for absent players.

## `/wishlist`

The `/wishlist` command allows users to add items they want to a wishlist with a priority level and an optional note.

```bash
/wishlist <priority> <item> [Optional: note]
```
### **Priority Levels**
* high 🔴
* medium 🟡
* low 🟢

Items are found by searching for the name of the item.
Optional: Users can add a note for more details.

## `/dkp`

view your dkp balance as an epherial message

```bash
/dkp
```

## `/mywishlist`

View your wishlist as an ephemeral message.

```bash
/mywishlist
```

## `/removewishlist`

Remove an item from your wishlist.

```

Search for the item name and select it. The item is removed from your wishlist immediately.
