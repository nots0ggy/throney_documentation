Throney offers three systems for managing loot in your alliance:

1. **Loot Bank**: Upload guild storage screenshots and AI extracts items for routing to auctions or listings.
2. **DKP Item Listings**: Simple upgrade/trait/litho bidding via Discord reactions.
3. **DKP Loot Auctions**: Live, DKP-based bidding with automatic deductions.

All systems are fully integrated with the Throney Dashboard and Discord.

## 📦 Loot Bank (AI-Powered Item Import)

The Loot Bank lets officers upload screenshots of their guild's item storage chest. Throney's AI extracts all visible items and matches them against the full game database (2000+ items).

### How It Works

1. Go to **Loot Bank** on the dashboard
2. Upload one or more screenshots of your guild storage
3. AI extracts item names and fuzzy-matches them to the database
4. Review the results. Search and reassign items if the AI got one wrong.
5. Select items and route them to **Auctions** or **Item Listings** in bulk

Multi-screenshot support means you can upload your entire storage chest at once.

## 📦 DKP Item Listings (Upgrade / Trait / Litho)

This system lets officers post an item to Discord and have users respond by selecting one of three interest categories:

- 🔺 **Upgrade** — High-priority gear for your main build.
- 🧬 **Trait** — Secondary spec or trait-related interest.
- 💎 **Litho** — Desired for lithograph crafting or exchange.

### 📌 How to Create a DKP Item Listing

1. Go to the **[Throney Dashboard](https://www.throney.gg)**.
2. Navigate to your **Alliance Dashboard**.
3. Under the **Item Panel**, click **Manage Items**.
4. Hit **"Add New Item"** and fill out the following:

- **Channel** – Where the item post will appear in Discord.
- **Item** – Choose from your guild’s loot list.
- **Notes** – Optional explanation or rules.

Once submitted, the bot posts the item to Discord with reactions for Upgrade, Trait, and Litho.

### 🧠 System Behavior

- Once a member reacts, the bot **marks them as responded**.
- Officers can **award the item** via the dashboard — the system will:
  - **Deduct DKP**
  - **Reject all other bidders automatically**

You can also use our internal "roll" system to roll the item between the reacted members.

> ⚠️ Always delete listings from the dashboard — not from Discord — to avoid sync issues.

## 🏦 DKP Loot Auction System (Live Bidding)

This is a **separate, advanced system** designed for real-time, competitive bidding.

### 📌 Features

- Officers can:
  - Set **starting bid**
  - Set **bid increment**
  - Configure the **Discord channel**
  - Define the **auction end time** (manual or auto)

- Members can:
  - Click **Bid** in Discord
  - Have DKP **automatically deducted**
  - Re-bid as long as they have balance (configurable soon)

### ⚙️ Staff Tools

- End auction manually from the dashboard
- Delete auction listings (also removes the Discord message)
- Void individual bids from the dashboard
- Auction visibility & history stored on the dashboard

> Auctions created on the dashboard take ~1-2 minutes to sync to Discord.

### Blind Auctions

Blind auctions (Vickrey-style) keep all bid information private. Bidder names, bid amounts, and real-time updates are hidden from other members. Only the winner is revealed when the auction ends.

### Outbid Notifications

When someone places a higher bid on an auction, the previous highest bidder receives a DM notification so they can bid again if they choose.

### Bid Safety

All bids use atomic database transactions to prevent DKP double-spend during race conditions. If two members bid at the same time, the system processes them safely in order.

## `/bulkadjust` (Officer Command)

Award or deduct DKP for all registered members in your alliance at once. Useful for season resets, weekly bonuses, or alliance-wide penalties.

```bash
/bulkadjust award 50
/bulkadjust deduct 25
```

All bulk operations are logged in the audit trail.
