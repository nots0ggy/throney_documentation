Throney's **Loadouts System** is the next evolution of the original **War Party Management** feature.

<Info>
  This feature replaces the older War Party system. Loadouts provide significantly more flexibility, including static templates, class-based party assignments, and dynamic party editing.

## 🔄 Transition from War Parties

Previously, War Parties allowed officers to manually organize members into preset static groups and post them to Discord.  
With the new **Loadouts System**, officers now have even greater automation and control:

- Create **Player-Based Templates** or **Class-Based Templates**.
- Automatically fill parties based on event signups.
- Freely edit or re-import loadouts as needed.
- Post party setups directly to Discord with the `/loadout` command.

Party setup happens faster, more accurately, and with less manual effort.

## 📋 How Loadouts Work

### 🛠 Creating a Loadout

1. Navigate to your **Alliance Dashboard**.
2. Select **Loadouts**.
3. Choose to create a **Player Template** or a **Class Template**.
4. Set up parties:
   - **Player Template**: Assign specific players to each party slot.
   - **Class Template**: Assign role types (Tank, MDPS, RDPS, Healer, Bomber) to each slot.

### 🧩 Importing a Loadout

When you **import** a loadout into a Event Signup:

- **Current party data is wiped**.
- The system generates parties based on your selected template.

**Player Templates**:
- Checks if the player is attending.
- If absent, leaves the slot empty.

**Class Templates**:
- Randomizes the attending list.
- Fills roles in party order, prioritizing earlier parties.
- Later parties may remain partially empty if there aren't enough players.

After importing:
- You can **manually adjust parties**, **move players**, or **re-import** another loadout if needed.
