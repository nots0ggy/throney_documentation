**Scheduled Events** (previously called "Dynamic Events" or "Signups") let members indicate their availability for upcoming events. Officers get a structured way to manage event participation through both the dashboard and Discord.

<Warning>
  **This feature is NOT a substitute for `/attendance`** – it does **not** take attendance automatically. Officers must still **use `/attendance` after the event** to log actual participation.
</Warning>

---

## 📌 Accessing Scheduled Events

To access the **Scheduled Events** panel:

1. **Go to the Throney Dashboard** and navigate to **Scheduled Events** in the sidebar.
2. Click on **"Manage Events"** to open the event management section.
3. In the **top right corner**, click the **"Add Event"** button to create a new event.

You can switch between **List view** and **Calendar view** using the tabs at the top of the page.

## 🛠️ Creating a Dynamic Event

When adding a new event, officers must configure the following settings:

- **Event Title** – The name of the event.
- **Description & Notes** – Any additional information regarding the event.
- **Signup Time** – The exact time the signup notification will be posted in Discord.
- **Event Time** – The scheduled start time of the event.
- **Recurring Event Settings** – Option to schedule repeating events every X days.
- **Event Role Requirement** – Restrict signups to specific roles (e.g., Tanks, DPS, Healers).
- **Ping Role** – The role that will be mentioned when the signup goes live.
- **Signup Channel** – The Discord channel where signups will be posted.
- **Updates Channel** – The Discord channel where event reminders and updates will be sent.
- **Voice Channel Selection** – Specify the voice channel where participants should gather.

Once all settings are filled out, click **"Save"** to finalize the event.

## 🧩 Signup Buttons on Discord

After a signup is posted in Discord, the following buttons will appear:

- `✅ Signups` – Displays attending, absent, tentative, ineligible, and unknown members.
- `🎉 Parties` – Displays each party and the characters in them.
- `🌐 Website` – Redirects to the respective signup’s page on the Throney Dashboard.
- `📣 Ping Unknown` – Allows officers to send a customizable reminder message to members who haven’t responded. The message appears as a reply to the original signup embed and is labeled with the staff member who sent it.

---

## ♻️ Recurring Events

When creating a signup, you can now configure the event to repeat every X days. Throney will automatically duplicate the signup and post it at the same interval.

This is ideal for daily/weekly siege planning, static content, and other repeatable events.

## 🧠 Party Builder (Loadouts)

Party creation is now fully integrated with Dynamic Events!

### Create Loadouts

You can create two types of templates:

- **Player Templates** – Build parties using specific players.
- **Class Templates** – Use role tags like Tank, Healer, RDPS, MDPS, Bomber.

### Loadout Import Behavior

- Importing a loadout clears your current party setup.
- Parties will be built based on your selected template.
  - **Player Templates** – Fills in members if they're attending.
  - **Class Templates** – Randomly fills in roles from the attendee pool.
- Parties may be partially or fully empty if users are not available.

After importing, you can freely **edit the loadout, move players**, or **import a new template**.

---

## 📜 New Command: `/loadout`

This new command shows party loadouts for your alliance directly in Discord.

```bash
/loadout
```

Skips loadouts that are empty or have no members.

Replaces the older /party command (now removed).
