The Wishlist system allows members to declare their desired items with priority levels, helping officers make informed loot decisions.

## 📌 How Wishlists Work

Members can add items to their wishlist with one of four priority levels:
- **Low** – Nice to have
- **Medium** – Would like this item
- **High** – Strongly desired upgrade
- **Archboss** – Top priority, essential item

## 🛠️ Managing Your Wishlist

### Adding Items

1. Navigate to **DKP → Wishlists** on the dashboard
2. Click **"Add Item"**
3. Search for the item from the database
4. Select your priority level
5. Save the wishlist entry

### Editing Priority

- Click on any wishlist item to change its priority
- Remove items you no longer need from the dashboard

### Removing Items via Discord

Use the `/removewishlist` command to remove an item from your wishlist directly in Discord.

```bash
/removewishlist <item>
```

## 👑 Officer View

Officers can view all member wishlists to:
- See who wants specific items
- Compare priority levels across members
- Make fair loot distribution decisions
- Remove individual items from a member's wishlist if needed

<Info>
  Wishlist data is used alongside DKP balance when deciding item awards. Higher priority + higher DKP typically wins.

## 📋 Wishlist in Loot Distribution

When an item drops:
1. Officer posts item via DKP Item Listing
2. Members react based on interest
3. Officer checks who has the item on their wishlist
4. Priority level + DKP balance determines winner

## 🎯 Best Practices

- Keep your wishlist updated as you get gear
- Use **Archboss** sparingly for truly essential items
- Remove items after receiving them
- Check class-appropriate items for your build
