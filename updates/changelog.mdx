We’ve rolled out several **quality of life improvements** to **Dynamic Events (Signups)** — making party management and attendance tracking even smoother 🚀

### 🆕 New Buttons Added to Dynamic Events (Signups)

Now shows party compositions directly within the signup embed.  
Includes:
- Party names
- Character names for each party

#### ✅ `Signups` Button  
Displays event attendance breakdowns:
- **Attending**
- **Absent**
- **Tentative**

Also introduces:
- 🟡 **Ineligible** → Users who do not have the required role  
- ⚪ **Unknown** → Users with the required role but haven’t responded yet  
Currently shown as pings — may switch to character names in a future update based on feedback.

#### ✅ `Website` Button  
Quick redirect to the signup's event page on the **Throney Dashboard**.

#### ✅ `Ping Unknown` Button  
An officer-only feature that:
- Sends a **custom message** to users who haven't marked attendance
- Labels the ping with the officer who sent it
- Posts as a **reply to the signup message** so it's easy to respond


### 🆕 New Public Command: `/loadout`

- View **Alliance Loadouts** directly in Discord
- Displays full party breakdowns
- ⚠️ Skips empty parties or loadouts with no members

> 🗑️ `/party` command has been removed  
> The website’s party builder is still available for now, but will eventually be phased out.

👉 We recommend converting your static party setups into **Loadouts** for smoother party planning.

---

### 🧪 Experimental Updates

You can now instantly populate your war parties using two types of templates:

When importing a template:

- If a player isn’t attending, their slot will remain empty

  * Expect a **\~1-2 minute delay** for item listings created on the website to appear in the configured channel

* ⚠ **Warning:** To avoid potential errors, always delete item listings from the **website dashboard** instead of directly in Discord.

***

### 🧪 **Experimental Updates – Absence System (Beta)**

* 🛠️ **/absent & /return commands** are now in **beta testing**

  * `/absent <From> <To> <Reason>` → Allows players to mark themselves absent

  * `/return` → Allows players to return early from an absence

  * Absences are reflected on **user profiles** and **announced in the configured channel**

* 📌 **Future Update (Post-T2 Launch)**:
