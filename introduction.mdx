## What is Throney?

Throney is an **all-in-one guild and alliance management system** for **Throne and Liberty**.

With **automated tools and simple commands**, Throney replaces spreadsheets and manual tracking so guilds can **focus on gameplay instead of administration**.

- **No Accounts Required**: Members do not need to create accounts or access dashboards.
- **One Command Setup**: `/upload` integrates a member instantly into the Throney system.
- **Officer Tools**: Officers get powerful management tools with automated tracking and full control.

### Language Support
Throney's OCR supports **English and Portuguese** class names natively. Players using other languages (German, French, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, etc.) will still have their class detected correctly through weapon combination matching.

For best results, **set your in-game language to English**. Non-English or special characters in player names (e.g., Korean, Russian) may cause name detection errors, which officers can fix with `/edit`.
